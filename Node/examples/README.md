## About
All samples use environment variables to store sensitive configuration information like APP_IDs and APP_SECRETS.  Please see the documentation about each sample to know how to configure it so that it functions correctly.  Also, all samples expect to be hosted on a publicly accessible HTTPS endpoint. If you're trying to run the sample on your local machine consider using something like [ngrok](https://ngrok.io) so you get SSL and a public endpoint instead of localhost.
